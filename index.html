                        <br>Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar BR pronounced
                        t̪eːɳɖulkəɾ]; born 24 April 1973 is an Indian former international cricketer who captained the
                        Indian national team. Nicknamed "The Little Master"[4] and "Master Blaster"[5], he is regarded
                        as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket.[6] He is the all-time highest
                        run-scorer in both ODI and Test cricket with more than 18,000 runs and 15,000 total runs
                        respectively.[7] He also holds the record for receiving the most man-of-the-match awards in
                        international cricket.[8] Known for his large fanbase and described by ESPNcricinfo as 'the most
                        worshipped player in the world'.[9] <br><br><br>Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven,
                        made
                        his Test match debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of sixteen, and
                        went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for close to twenty-four
                        years. In 2002, halfway through his career, Wisden ranked him the second-greatest Test batsman
                        of all time, behind Don Bradman, and the second-greatest ODI batsman of all time, behind Viv
                        Richards.[10] Later in his career, Tendulkar was part of the Indian team that won the 2011
                        Cricket World Cup, his first win in six World Cup appearances for India.[11] He had previously
                        been named "Player of the Tournament" at the 2003 edition of the tournament.
                        <br><br><br>Tendulkar
                        received the Arjuna Award in 1994 for his outstanding sporting achievements, the Khel Ratna
                        Award, India's highest sporting honour, in 1997, and the Padma Shri and Padma Vibhushan awards
                        in 1999 and 2008, respectively, two of India's highest civilian awards.[12][13] A few hours
                        after the end of his last match in November 2013, the Prime Minister's Office announced the
                        decision to award him the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award.[14][15] As of 2021, he
                        is the youngest recipient to date and was the first sportsperson to receive the award.[16][17]
                        In 2012, Tendulkar was nominated to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Parliament of
                        India.[18]
                        <br><br><br>
                        In 2010, Time magazine included Tendulkar in its annual Time 100 list as one of the most
                        influential people in the world.[19] Tendulkar was awarded the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy for
                        cricketer of the year at the 2010 ICC Awards.[20] Having retired from ODI cricket in
                        2012,[21][22] he retired from all forms of cricket in November 2013 after playing his 200th Test
                        match.[23] Tendulkar played 664 international cricket matches in total, scoring 34,357 runs.[24]
                        <br><br><br><br>
                        Tendulkar has received several awards from the government of India: the Arjuna Award (1994), the
                        Khel Ratna Award (1997), the Padma Shri (1998), and the Padma Vibhushan (2008).[10][11] After
                        Tendulkar played his last match in November 2013, the Prime Minister's Office announced the
                        decision to award him the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award.[12][13] He was the first
                        sportsperson to receive the reward, and as of 2021, he is the youngest recipient and was the
                        first sportsperson to receive the award.[14][15] In 2012, Tendulkar was nominated to the Rajya
                        Sabha, the upper house of the Parliament of India.[16]

                    <h2>Early years</h2> <br>
                    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tendulkar was born at Nirmal Nursing Home in Dadar, Bombay on 24 April 1973[25][26] to a Rajapur
                        Saraswat Brahmin[better source needed] Maharastrian family.[27][28] His father, Ramesh
                        Tendulkar,
                        was a Marathi-language novelist and poet while his mother, Rajni, worked in the insurance
                        industry.[29] Tendulkar's father named him after his favourite music director, Sachin Dev
                        Burman.[30] Tendulkar has three older siblings: two half-brothers Nitin and Ajit, and a
                        half-sister
                        Savita. They were his father's children by his first wife, who died after the birth of her third
                        child.[31][32] His brother Ajit played in Bombay's Kanga Cricket League.[33]
                        <br><br>
                        Tendulkar spent his formative years in the Sahitya Sahawas Cooperative Housing Society in Bandra
                        (East). As a young boy, Tendulkar was considered a bully, and he often picked fights with new
                        children in his school.[34] <br><br>

                        As a child, Tendulkar was interested in both tennis and cricket. He particularly idolised
                        American
                        player John McEnroe, and emulated his hero by growing his hair long at the age of 7 or 8 years.
                        At
                        this time, Tendulkar also regularly wore tennis wristbands and headbands, and carried a tennis
                        racquet with him as a sign of his love for tennis.[35][36][37]
                        <br>
                        In 2010, Time included Tendulkar in its annual list of the most influential people in the
                        world.[17] Tendulkar was awarded the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy for cricketer of the year at the
                        2010 International Cricket Council (ICC) Awards.[18]

                        Having retired from ODI cricket in 2012,[19][20] he retired from all forms of cricket in
                        November 2013 after playing his 200th Test match.[21] Tendulkar played 664 international cricket
                        matches in total, scoring 34,357 runs.[22] In 2013, Tendulkar was included in an all-time Test
                        World XI to mark the 150th anniversary of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, and he was the only
                        specialist batsman of the post–World War II era, along with Viv Richards, to get featured in the -->
